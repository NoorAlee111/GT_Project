"Immunity is on the minds of all of us these days, for all the reasons. If you’re looking to give your immune system a bit of a boost — in addition to getting your vaccine and following all of the current CDC guidelines — read on for a guest article from Laura May, digital editor at Just Another Magazine, about five things you might be doing that’s actually making your immune system weaker.  Cultivating a strong immune system is a smart objective, and the events of the COVID-19 pandemic have provided a sharp reminder of why you should make it a priority. The lower your body’s defenses are, the more easily you can have your life derailed by whatever ailment happens to be going around — and while COVID-19 has done an immense amount of damage, we’ve always been surrounded by diseases that have the potential to hit us hard. Unfortunately, at a time when it’s more important than ever to be capable of fighting off infections, many of us have weaker immune systems than our ancestors. There’s no need to panic, though, because your immune system isn’t set in stone: if you address the issues that are making it weaker, you can shore up your guard and be ready for whatever may attack you. In this post, we’re going to look at five things that are negatively affecting your immune system. If you can take suitable action, you can give yourself a boost. Let’s get to them: Stress is something we all have to deal with, but to varying degrees. Light stress is fine: it challenges you to excel, keeping you motivated. But heavy stress, or stress that you go through on an everyday basis, is a different prospect altogether. That kind of stress can cause no end of problems, disrupting your bodily systems and leaving you struggling to get anything done. If you can address the things that are causing your stress, do so. If you can’t, though, you’ll need to figure out ways to change how they make you feel. Learning to let go of what you can’t control isn’t easy (there are few things harder, in truth), but it can be done if you commit to the process and stay open-minded about things like introspection and meditation. Therapy is also awesome for this! During tough times, it’s easy to fall into bad less-than-nutritious habits, whether you’re regularly grabbing fast-food after a long workday or overindulging on alcohol at the weekend — those habits can impact your immune system. Try to work more fruits and vegetables that you like into your regular meal rotation. Nothing extreme: just do whatever you can manage. (Remember, all good things in moderation!)",Health and Fitness
"2020 has been something, huh? Because of all of the things, we are thrilled to be sharing this guest post from Bernadette Pleasant, the founder of The Emotional Institute, an online resource and educational center that offers courses, workshops, and interactive experiences that provide pathways to cultivate emotional wellbeing and gain insights that bring about a balanced mind/body connection. Bernadette has spent a lifetime exploring celebrations of the mind and body, from sensual dance to somatic healing. As a woman of color who comes from an esteemed tradition of natural healers, she is recognized as a leader in the mind-body wellness realm.  We had Bernadette on our podcast last year and let me just say that it’s an episode you definitely don’t want to miss (and if you heard it already, it’s worth another listen!). Get it here. Now, read on for the one ritual Bernadette says we all need to do to not only help deal with all of the stress of 2020, but also how to help us heal our own past wounds so that we can all find true, authentic joy in our lives (even amidst of all of what’s happening). Gosh knows we all need that!  Grief has always been an essential emotion of humanity, in every place and every time. Yet for many of us, there has been an upswell in grief during these trying times. Grief, always there below the surface, has now broken through the veil to the forefront of our consciousness. Many have experienced the quintessential grief of losing a loved one during this time. We are also struggling with the loss of personal freedom, loneliness, racism, worry of infection, unemployment and business loss — the list is endless. Frustration compounds grief as many people feel helpless and don’t know how they can make a meaningful difference. Fear, hate, and grief fills the body. There is so much that needs airing, that needs to be felt, heard, seen, and moved through. In response to the events of 2020, we have created the Grief Ritual. This virtual practice (sign up for it here — it’s free and ongoing) brings us together to hold space for one another as we move through the emotions we are experiencing, from new sorrows triggered by recent events to old grief that is coming to the surface. Whether grief is fresh and raw or has been smoldering for decades, whether it is interpersonal or existential, ecological or ancestral, the Grief Ritual facilitates its expression and release. Healing begins in community. This embodied, somatic work invites you to access and express emotion in a supportive community. It gives you the safe space to release grief, sorrow, anger, fear, and numbness — a cathartic and deeply transformative experience.",Health and Fitness
" There’s no doubt that the last year and a half has been stressful for all of us, for all the reasons. And, while it seems as though we’re starting to settle back into some semblance of normal (whatever that means!), some of those big stressors and emotions are, well, still very much present. In a lot of ways, those fears and anxieties are almost hard to let go of after living so long in a locked down world. None of us want to be stressed, of course, but it seems that many of us are finding letting go and relaxing to be really, really challenging. It’s almost as though our default emotional system and body is set to high alert, and we’re afraid to lower it to more feel-good levels. Because of all of that and SO MUCH MORE as you’ll read, we are thrilled to share an excerpt from Tracee Stanley’s book Radiant Rest: Yoga Nidra for Deep Relaxation and Awakened Clarity.  Tracee is a noted and lineaged teacher of yoga nidra, meditation, and self-inquiry. Her practices are inspired by the tradition of Himalayan Masters and Sri Vidya Tantra, into which she was initiated in 2001. She is co-founder of the Empowered Wisdom Yoga Nidra School and created the Empowered Life Self-Inquiry Oracle Deck. Tracee travels internationally leading retreats, teacher training, and presenting at festivals and conferences including Oprah and Gayle’s Girls Get Away. She has online classes available at Commune, Yoga Journal, Unplug Meditation, Pranamaya, and Wanderlust TV. For more information, go to her site here. Credit: Anastasia Chomlack Her new book Radiant Rest is a must-read for those interested in self-development and inquiry. Through the book, Tracee guides readers beyond the technique of yoga nidra and into the depths in order to experience deep relaxation and awaken to your power. She offers bedtime and wake-up rituals, along with insights on some of the obstacles many of us have to relaxation and the factors that play a part in blocking us from our birthright of deep rest and spiritual awakening. It’s an incredible read. And, in this excerpt from her book, Tracee is sharing why it’s so hard for us to relax, ways to heal, and practical tips to find ease, and —  best of all — finally get some radiant rest. One of the first things I became aware of, as I began to practice and then share deep relaxation, was that it’s difficult for most of us to “let go.” Yoga teachers often give this instruction without the slightest consideration for how it will be received in a class full of people with varied life experiences and possible traumas. At the very least, life can be stressful, and over time it can create the type of tension that requires more than commanding ourselves to “let go” to relax.",Health and Fitness

"smitten kitchen I have several stuffing-related confessions to unload today: My first stuffing love was found at a friend’s house, when her mother served us an apple stuffing from a Pepperidge Farm mix that is no longer made, I presume because it’s not 1989. My god, did I nag my mother (who wasn’t terribly keen on packaged foods, meanie) to make it too. Sometimes she’d cave, though never often enough, but it didn’t stop me from growing up thinking that the dreamiest stuffing includes tart apples, celery, lightly caramelized onions and herbs, a dream I was repeatedly denied as a child and yes, I’m requesting a very tiny violin.   I think if you’re limiting your stuffing consumption to a single day in November, you are missing out. When you snip stuffing free of its holiday-specific tethers, it doesn’t take long to realize how welcome it could be speared onto your fork the other 364 days a year, a category it shares with latkes (as awesome at cocktail parties as they are for weekend breakfasts topped with a lacy-edged fried egg, and especially fitting this year), yule logs (for Thanksgiving or just the mega-Yodel of it) and fairy lights, which you should not even pretend aren’t as awesome strung across a yard on a July evening as they are outlining shutters and fire escapes in December. I would eat stuffing every week of the year if everyone would stop looking at me so strangely about it.   I am so insistent that stuffing tastes amazing during the breakfast meal with a loosely cooked egg on top, at lunch, aside a salad, instead of a roll, or dinner on days that are not Thanksgiving, in lieu of a grain or potato, that I went to extensive lengths to develop a recipe called Breakfast Stuffing (but really a Stuffing For All Meals) for The Smitten Kitchen Cookbook, something of an herbed and savory but not really eggy breakfast strata, studded with my favorite stuffing flavors. I tested and tested and tested this. We enjoyed and enjoyed and enjoyed it. But, nobody else could get their head around it. Every person I mentioned it to said, “Yeah? Breakfast Stuffing, huh?” in that oh-that-scribble-was-a-dinosaur? voice. I know the oh-that-scribble-was-a-dinosaur voice. So, I pulled it, and it has lived on my computer since, hoping to one day find a home.  It’s been four years. Maybe it’s time?",Food
"smitten kitchen In one of my favorite October traditions, we picked too many apples a few weekends ago. As in maybe perhaps 25 pounds more than we needed? It’s hard to gauge. I realize that if you’ve never been in an apple orchard in October, when you’ve escaped the city to find yourselves in a quiet grove as the leaves are just starting to turn and the sky is unimaginably blue and you’re wearing your first thick sweater of the season, it’s hard to imagine how one accidentally picks 25 pounds too many apples. But I bet if you’ve been there and felt that, how fun it is to pluck crisp, unblemished, unwaxed apples from trees and let the branches snap back and the leaves flutter droplets of last night’s rain over your face, you’ve probably gotten carried away too. I think picking too many apples in October is about as important of a tradition as burning food on a backyard grill over July 4th weekend and going through a whole jar of cinnamon every fall. It’s going to happen either way; it’s best to embrace it.   But when we got back to our distinctly not-grove-sized apartment, we didn’t have anywhere to put them. So, we started with applesauce, eight pounds of it. We moved onto oatmeal cookie-ish crumbles (would you like the recipe?), which chipped away at a few pounds apiece, and then my son’s preschool was making something with apples and I was all “LET ME DONATE THEM PLEASE.” There were whole wheat apple muffins (which enlisted 2), then apple pancakes (another 2), and then we made more applesauce (4 pounds) and all of a sudden we had only 6 apples left and I was devastated, because I’d forgotten to make pie. Who forgets to make pie? Nobody you should be friends with.  Especially when it comes to this pie. I realize that the slab pie is not something new here, but we only discussed it in the realm of sour cherries, which have a season as long as the average blink. Slab pie deserves to have more time with you, and there are several good things to know about it. It has a higher proportion of crust-to-filling than your standard 9-inch round double-crusted pie, so if you’re into flaky, buttery crusts, hello, welcome home.* Speaking of flaky and buttery, I’ve found that the crusts of slab pies, unweighted by thick fruit fillings, tend to puff into gorgeous flakes far more readily than standard pie crusts do. But who’d be into a thing like that?  Slab pie slices are portable, like a thick, thick pop tart or a hand pie, but not the kind that requires all of that pesky rolling and cutting and sealing, to be repeated until you’re no longer certain that you even really like pie or your friends enough for it to be worth it. Slab pie would never do that to you.",Food

"By Althea Need Kaminske Cover image by Pexels from Pixabay One of the most common metaphors to describe what the first few years of medical school is like is that it is like drinking water from a fire hose. There is an overwhelming amount of information that students need to learn, and need to learn fast. One of the areas that I help medical students with is in improving their notetaking to help them manage the “fire hose” of information. The way I define notetaking here is probably a little different than how most people think of notetaking. In this context I think of notes as any record of learning that is formatted to improve understanding and long-term retention of material. Ideally this record should be continually updated so that it is a living document of progress towards learning goals. This means that notes could include: handwritten flashcards, typed out charts and tables, annotated diagrams, sketches of flowcharts and mind maps, etc. What makes notes good or effective depends on the goals you have for the notes. For example, a common question is whether it matters if you take notes by hand or typed out on a device. Generally, I would argue that the format doesn’t matter so much as the cognitive processes that you engage in while making the notes (see this post by Megan explaining more). Notes taken by hand tend to be better because it’s harder to take notes by hand - forcing you to be selective about what you write down and to paraphrase things into your own words (1). It’s the selectivity and paraphrasing that’s helpful for memory and understanding, not the physical movement of your hands. Once you know about this, it’s easy to apply the same principles to typed notes. However, if your goals for notetaking are to provide some sort of transcription of the event, then, yes, typing notes will most likely be faster and easier for that goal. Effective note-taking in medical school needs to achieve several goals. First, notes need to be formatted to aid subsequent retention (i.e. spaced retrieval practice). Second, they need to condense the fire hose of information into something more manageable. Third, they need to be done in a way that builds understanding of the material. And finally, they should be a record of learning to help track and monitor learning - a living document that reflects current understanding. Good notes are notes that are: Formatted for spaced retrieval practice Condensing large amounts of information Building understanding Recording and monitoring understanding In the book Study Without Stress by Eugenia G. Kelman and Kathleen Straker (2), the authors cover five different note formats that meet those goals. They cover flashcards, diagrams, flowcharts, charts and tables, and combinations.",Science and Education
"By Samantha Jensen Samantha is currently a Level 4 Psychology student at the University of Glasgow (UofG), and very passionate about delving into the realm of neurodiversity in higher education. Specifically, ensuring that other marginalized groups receive the support they truly deserve. The process of writing this reflective piece has only intensified her enthusiasm for this subject area. It had also significantly influenced her previous summer research project, where she delved into the world of dyslexic students and their ability to code in a university setting. This passion of hers has propelled her into dedicating her final year dissertation to the exploration of neurodiversity within UofG. She is keen on uncovering the extent to which individuals feel the right amount of support and inclusivity in their studies. She is absolutely delighted to share her experiences and passion for the Student Voice within the TILE Network. This opportunity allowed her to contribute actively to the ongoing dialogue surrounding the importance of support and inclusivity in higher education. * Note: This piece was originally published on the TILE Network website. Here is the link to the original source. When I first encountered the concept of neurodiversity and began to understand what it meant to be neurodivergent, I was embarking on my university journey. At that point, my awareness of my mild dyscalculia diagnosis had only emerged during my high school years. It was a time when I grappled with self-consciousness, a sense of disorientation, and anxiety, particularly as I was just starting to engage in critical reflections about the world around me. As I was entering university, I remember wondering “How do I manage this new chapter with my diagnoses?” “Is there any support available for someone like me?” “Are there others who share similar experiences and challenges?” As my understanding of neurodiversity deepened, I became interested in exploring neurodivergent students in Higher Education (HE). Syharat et al. (1) investigated neurodivergent graduate STEM student experiences. The results suggest that they often feel pressure to conform to neurotypical norms and avoid negative perceptions. Furthermore, participants also noted that they may have to self-silence to maintain stability and a positive relationship with their advisor. This research highlights the importance of attending to inclusive environments in HE. Moreover, it also illuminates the hurdles that neurodivergent students encounter during their educational journey. Another study (2) investigated a neurodivergent population specifically autistic students in both undergraduate and graduate students. The findings suggest that their experience was fluid and multi-dimensional in which multiple factors may affect students’ sense of belonging, transitional period and support. Building upon these insights it is crucial to explore the present initiatives that have been designed to support students in HE.",Science and Education
"By Cindy Nebel cover image from Pixabay by padrinan Interleaving is the idea that, while learning, we will learn more if we jumble up our review of similar materials, rather than reviewing one concept at a time in a blocked format. Interleaving has been shown to be effective in the laboratory (1) as well as the classroom (2) and for different types of materials (3). One thing that we’ve heard from educators is that they worry interleaving can be too challenging for students and that students need some blocking first. Cue this week’s research review blog post: Veronica Yan and Faria Sana looked at just this issue (4). Is it possible that blocking is better than interleaving when the material is more challenging? Would some students need blocking before interleaving? Image from Pixabay by geralt There’s a reason to think they might. For example, in one study, when learners were learning different tennis strokes, blocking was actually a bit better than interleaving for lower-skilled students (5). But what does “lower-skilled” equate to when we’re not talking about tennis? Would we find these same effects across classrooms? In the present study, the researchers looked at these questions in a number of ways. They had three main variables they were interested in: Student skill, which they defined as working memory capacity (or, more simply, how much can a student hold in mind at a time) Task difficulty Interleaving vs. blocking Image from Pixabay by flutie8211 They tried this with different types of materials in their first few experiments. Participants learned to distinguish different painters in Experiment 1 and different types of fish in Experiment 2. Overall, what they found is that interleaving was superior to blocking all the time (with the small exception when things were too hard or too easy - then it didn’t matter if you blocked or interleaved). This means that students with lower skill, getting difficulty problems, were still better off interleaving than they were blocking. There’s one more very important part of this set of experiments. They also asked students after they had already been tested which condition would be most effective and about 80% of students said that blocking was better for learning. This is crazy. They’ve already done the task and they still don’t realize what was good for them! The researchers also asked whether any of the participants themselves showed a benefit from blocking. So that is, even if we average the class and find that interleaving is better, what if for Sally and Joe, blocking was actually a big better but because they are in the minority, we don’t notice when we look at the class as a whole? Well, it turns out that there were some participants who did a little better with blocking sometimes, but not consistently. Across all the different materials, conditions, and learners in this study, interleaving was almost always found to be superior to blocking and blocking was never better than interleaving. Interleaving is really effective.",Science and Education
